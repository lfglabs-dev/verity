# Trust Assumptions and Verification Boundaries

This document states what Verity proves and what it still trusts.

## Compilation Pipeline

```
EDSL (Lean)
  ↓ [Layer 1: PROVEN FOR CURRENT CONTRACTS, generic core, contract bridges]
CompilationModel
  ↓ [Layer 2: SUPPORTED-FRAGMENT GENERIC THEOREM -- CompilationModel → IR]
IR
  ↓ [Layer 3: GENERIC SURFACE, explicit bridge hypothesis, IR → Yul]
Yul
  ↓ [trusted: solc]
EVM Bytecode
```

The repository currently has 0 `sorry` placeholders across the `Compiler/**/*.lean` and `Verity/**/*.lean` proof modules that participate in the verified compiler stack. Layer 2 (Source → IR) and Layer 3 (IR → Yul) proof scripts are fully discharged, and it now has 0 documented Lean axioms. See [AXIOMS.md](AXIOMS.md) for details. Audit evidence and generated trust-boundary artifacts are indexed in [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md).

## What's Verified

- **Layer 1**: A generic typed-IR compilation-correctness core exists, but the active contract-level bridges are still instantiated per contract and internal-helper proof reuse is not yet a first-class generic interface.
  This names the frontend EDSL-to-`CompilationModel` bridge only; the
  contract-specific specification theorems in `Contracts/<Name>/Proofs/` are a
  separate proof layer about human-readable contract behavior.
- **Layer 2**: A generic whole-contract theorem is proved for the current supported `CompilationModel` fragment. `supported_function_correct` is now a real theorem, the initial-state normalization step is proved, the former generic body-simulation axiom has been eliminated, and the theorem surface makes explicit that the observed transaction-context fields must already be normalized to the bounded source-side `Address`/`Uint256` domains. Remaining Layer 2 work is now about widening the supported fragment and helper-aware completeness, not repairing `sorry` placeholders.
- **Layer 3**: IR → Yul preservation is generic at the proof surface, and the remaining dispatch bridge now lives as an explicit theorem hypothesis rather than a Lean axiom. The checked contract-level theorem surface makes the dispatch-guard safety preconditions explicit: non-payable cases must see word-level zero `msg.value`, and each selected function case must have a non-wrapping calldata-width guard.

Current theorem totals, property-test coverage, and proof status live in [docs/VERIFICATION_STATUS.md](docs/VERIFICATION_STATUS.md).

## Trusted Components

### 1. Solidity Compiler (`solc`)
- **Role**: Compiles Yul → EVM bytecode.
- **Version**: 0.8.33+commit.64118f21 (pinned).
- **Mitigation**: CI enforces pin and Yul compileability checks.

### 2. Lean Axioms
- **Role**: Bridge remaining proof obligations not yet fully discharged.
- **Status**: 0 documented axioms in [AXIOMS.md](AXIOMS.md). The mapping-slot range axiom has been eliminated via the kernel-computable Keccak engine. Selector computation is kernel-computable, the Layer 2 generic body-simulation axiom has been eliminated, and the Layer 3 dispatch bridge remains an explicit theorem hypothesis rather than a Lean axiom.
- **Mitigation**: CI axiom reporting and location checks enforce explicit tracking.

### 3. Keccak-based Selector Computation
- **Role**: Function selector derivation (`bytes4(keccak256(signature))`).
- **Status**: kernel-computable in `Compiler/Selectors.lean` via the vendored unrolled Keccak engine in `Compiler/Keccak/`.
- **Mitigation**: CI cross-checks against `solc --hashes`, selector fixtures, and fixed selector examples.

### 4. Linked Yul Libraries
- **Role**: External functions injected at compile time (e.g., Poseidon hash).
- **Trust**: Semantic correctness of linked code. Compiler validates names, arities, collisions.

### 5. Mapping Slot Derivation
- **Role**: `keccak256(abi.encode(key, baseSlot))` for Solidity-compatible storage (`activeMappingSlotBackend = .keccak`).
- **Trust**: external keccak implementation (`ffi.KEC` via EVMYul FFI) + standard collision-resistance assumptions (same trust class as Solidity/EVM).
- **Mitigation**: Abstraction-boundary CI, selector/hash cross-checks.
- **Audit surface**: machine-readable trust reports now emit the explicit primitive assumption `keccak256_memory_slice_matches_evm` whenever a contract uses `Expr.keccak256`.

### 6. EVM/Yul Semantics and Gas
- **Role**: Runtime execution model.
- **Status (native transition complete)**: native builtin dispatch lives in `Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Backends/EvmYulLeanBuiltinSemantics.lean` and `Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Backends/EvmYulLeanNativeLowering.lean`; `EvmYulLeanBridgeLemmas.lean` records native routing facts for the 36 covered builtin cases, including 25 universal pure bridge theorems. All pure bridge cases are now covered by universal symbolic lemmas. The legacy runtime-oracle stack and builtin comparison oracle have been removed as part of the EVMYulLean transition (DoD-5). The public EndToEnd composition surface in `Compiler/Proofs/EndToEnd.lean` targets native `EvmYul.Yul.callDispatcher` execution through `Compiler.Proofs.YulGeneration.Backends.EvmYulLeanNativeHarness`: the public surface is `nativeResultsMatchOn`, `sourceResultMatchesNativeOn`, the source/native result-composition theorem over that native result surface, and the concrete SimpleStorage native theorem. The fuel-indexed `nativeIRRuntimeMatchesIR` seams are file-local. Gas is not modeled.
- **Trust boundary (EVMYulLean EndToEnd target)**: For the native EndToEnd path, the runtime authority is EVMYulLean dispatcher execution after Verity Yul is lowered by the native harness and projected onto the observable result surface. There is no longer a legacy preservation/equivalence stack; only the native chain remains.
- **Fork dependency**: Verity pins [`lfglabs-dev/EVMYulLean`](https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/EVMYulLean), a fork of [`NethermindEth/EVMYulLean`](https://github.com/NethermindEth/EVMYulLean). The pinned commit is recorded in `lake-manifest.json` under the `evmyul` package. The exact divergence from upstream is enumerated in [`artifacts/evmyullean_fork_audit.json`](artifacts/evmyullean_fork_audit.json), regenerated by `scripts/generate_evmyullean_fork_audit.py` and validated by `make check`. As of the current pin, the fork is 2 commits ahead of `upstream/main` and 0 behind; both commits are non-semantic (one visibility change on an exponentiation accumulator, one Lean 4.22.0 deprecation fix), so upstream Ethereum conformance test coverage applies transitively. In addition to the `make check` validation, a weekly scheduled GitHub Actions workflow ([`.github/workflows/evmyullean-fork-conformance.yml`](.github/workflows/evmyullean-fork-conformance.yml)) runs `make test-evmyullean-fork`, which re-verifies the fork audit artifact against `lake-manifest.json`, checks the EVMYulLean native lowering report, rebuilds the native transition harness, rebuilds the public EndToEnd EVMYulLean target, and rebuilds the native builtin routing lemmas together with the native bridge smoke tests and 0 concrete bridge tests, surfacing any upstream drift as a red workflow plus an automatically opened or updated GitHub issue for scheduled/manual failures.
- **Remaining gap for whole-program retargeting**: The public EndToEnd native surface is in place, but the per-`BridgedStraightStmt` IR↔native observation-equivalence framework that would land truly unconditional S1–S8 / F2/F4/F6/F7 / true S8 has not been built yet — that work is multi-week and tracked separately. The external-call/function-table family now has function-table-aware closure scaffolding in `Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Backends/EvmYulLeanCallClosure.lean` (per-family source-level predicates, per-family `compileStmt`/`compileStmtList` closure theorems, `ECMBridgeable` per-module obligation, and a `BridgedStmts`-preserving `pfx ++ sfx` composition lemma); end-to-end wiring through `SupportedFragment`/`SupportedSpec` for whole contracts using these constructors is the next milestone.
- **Implication**: Semantic correctness does not imply gas-safety.
- **Proxy note**: `delegatecall`-based proxy / upgradeability flows still sit outside the current native verified runtime model. Archive `--trust-report` and use `--deny-proxy-upgradeability` when proxy semantics must remain outside the selected verified subset (issue `#1420`).

### 7. External Call Modules (ECMs)
- **Role**: Reusable typed external call patterns (ERC-20 writes/reads including `totalSupply`, ERC-4626 preview/conversion helpers plus `totalAssets`, `asset`, `max*` limit reads, and `deposit`, oracle reads, precompiles 0x01 / 0x02 / 0x06 / 0x07 / 0x08 — `ecrecover`, `sha256`, BN254 `bn256Add`, `bn256ScalarMul`, `bn256Pairing` — callbacks).
- **Trust**: Each module's `compile` produces correct Yul. Bug in one module doesn't affect others.
- **Mitigation**: Axiom aggregation at compile time (`--verbose`), machine-readable trust-surface emission via `--trust-report <path>`, and a fail-closed verification gate via `--deny-unchecked-dependencies` when unchecked foreign surfaces must be excluded. See [docs/EXTERNAL_CALL_MODULES.md](docs/EXTERNAL_CALL_MODULES.md).

### 8. Lean Kernel
- **Role**: Proof checker soundness. Foundational assumption for all Lean-based verification.

### 9. Macro Elaborator (`verity_contract`)
- **Role**: Generates both EDSL `Contract` monad value and `CompilationModel` from one syntax tree.
- **Status**: Trusted unverified metaprogram ([Verity/Macro/Translate.lean](Verity/Macro/Translate.lean)).
- **Risk**: A translation bug would silently cause EDSL and CompilationModel to diverge.
- **Mitigation**: The generic Layer 2 whole-contract theorem, macro-generated `_semantic_preservation` body-alignment checks, and differential tests catch divergence on the current contract set.

### 10. Local Unsafe / Refinement Obligations
- **Role**: Let a function or constructor declare a localized proof obligation for an unsafe/assembly-shaped boundary without marking the whole contract as opaque.
- **Status**: Surfaced explicitly in `--trust-report`, `--verbose`, and `proofStatus.*.localObligations`.
- **Mitigation**: `verity-compiler --deny-local-obligations` fails closed on any obligation that remains `assumed` or `unchecked`.

## Semantic Caveats

### Wrapping Arithmetic
`Uint256` arithmetic is **wrapping modulo 2^256**, matching the EVM. This is proven, not assumed (see `Compiler/Proofs/ArithmeticProfile.lean`). Checked operations (`safeAdd`, `safeSub`, `safeMul`) are available for overflow protection. See [docs/ARITHMETIC_PROFILE.md](docs/ARITHMETIC_PROFILE.md).

### Revert-State Modeling
High-level semantics can expose intermediate state in reverted computations. EVM reverts discard state. Contracts should use checks-before-effects. See [docs/REVERT_STATE_MODEL.md](docs/REVERT_STATE_MODEL.md).

## Security Audit Checklist

1. Confirm deployment uses the supported EDSL CLI path.
2. Review [AXIOMS.md](AXIOMS.md); ensure the axiom list is unchanged and justified.
3. If linked libraries are used, audit each linked Yul file as trusted code.
4. Validate selector, Yul compile, and storage-layout CI checks.
5. Confirm arithmetic and revert assumptions are acceptable for the target contract.
6. Review the low-level mechanics / external assumption report (`--verbose`) and archive `--trust-report <path>` for audit evidence when external calls or linked externals are used. For verification-oriented builds, also pass `--deny-unchecked-dependencies` so any remaining unchecked foreign surface fails closed.

## Planned Hardening

- **Issue #967**: Proof-carrying Yul rewrite rules, versioned parity packs, AST identity gates.
- **Issue #998**: Per-function machine-checked `EDSL execution ≡ EVMYulLean(compile(CompilationModel))` theorems.
