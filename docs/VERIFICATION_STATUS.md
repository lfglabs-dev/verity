## Architecture

Verity implements a **three-layer verification stack** proving smart contracts correct from specification to Yul bytecode:

```
EDSL contracts (Lean)
    ↓ Layer 1: EDSL ≡ CompilationModel [PROVEN FOR CURRENT CONTRACTS; GENERIC CORE, CONTRACT BRIDGES]
CompilationModel (declarative compiler-facing model)
    ↓ Layer 2: CompilationModel → IR [GENERIC WHOLE-CONTRACT THEOREM]
Intermediate Representation (IR)
    ↓ Layer 3: IR → Yul [GENERIC SURFACE, EXPLICIT BRIDGE HYPOTHESIS]
Yul (EVM Assembly)
    ↓ (Trusted: solc compiler)
EVM Bytecode
```

## Layer 1: EDSL ≡ CompilationModel, PROVEN FOR CURRENT CONTRACTS

**What it proves today**: The EDSL `Contract` monad execution is equivalent to `CompilationModel` interpretation for the current supported contract set. This is the frontend semantic bridge. The proof stack has a generic typed-IR core, but the active bridge theorems are still instantiated per contract. Separate per-contract proofs under `Contracts/<Name>/Proofs/` then show these contracts satisfy their human-readable specifications; those specification theorems are downstream contract proofs, not the definition of Layer 1 itself.

Layer 1 uses macro-generated EDSL-to-`CompilationModel` bridge theorems backed by a generic typed-IR compilation-correctness theorem ([`TypedIRCompilerCorrectness.lean`](../Compiler/TypedIRCompilerCorrectness.lean)). Tuple/bytes/fixed-array/dynamic-array/string parameters now stay inside that proof path when they are carried as ABI head words/offsets. Advanced constructs beyond that typed-IR head-word surface (linked libraries, ECMs, fully custom ABI behavior) are still expressed directly in `CompilationModel` and trusted at that boundary.

Internal helper calls are supported operationally in `CompilationModel` and the fuel-based interpreter path, but helper-level compositional proof reuse across callers is not yet a first-class verified interface. Current EDSL-to-`CompilationModel` bridge instantiations remain contract-specific; the remaining proof-level helper boundary is tracked in the Layer 2 completeness roadmap under [#1630](https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/verity/issues/1630), with the current interface/boundary refactor in [#1633](https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/verity/pull/1633).

## Layer 2: CompilationModel → IR — GENERIC WHOLE-CONTRACT THEOREM

Tracking:
- Theorem-shape milestone: [#1510](https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/verity/issues/1510)
- Follow-on widening/completeness work: [#1630](https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/verity/issues/1630)
- Axiom-elimination work completed in: [#1618](https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/verity/issues/1618)
- Machine-readable boundary catalog: [`artifacts/layer2_boundary_catalog.json`](../artifacts/layer2_boundary_catalog.json)

**What is generic today**:
- a structural theorem for raw statement lists inside the explicit `SupportedStmtList` fragment witness in [`TypedIRCompilerCorrectness.lean`](../Compiler/TypedIRCompilerCorrectness.lean), re-exported for the compiler-proof layer in [`SupportedFragment.lean`](../Compiler/Proofs/IRGeneration/SupportedFragment.lean)
- a whole-contract theorem surface, [`compile_preserves_semantics`](../Compiler/Proofs/IRGeneration/Contract.lean), quantified over arbitrary supported `CompilationModel`s, selectors, a `SupportedSpec` witness, and successful `CompilationModel.compile` output; the source side is already expressed in the helper-aware semantics family using the canonical `SupportedSpec.helperFuel` bound

**What is not yet covered**:
- the supported whole-contract fragment is still intentionally narrower than the full `CompilationModel` surface; unsupported features remain documented at the boundary instead of being claimed as proved
- the body-level supported-fragment witness is now decomposed into feature-local interfaces (`core`, `state`, `calls`, `effects`) in [`SupportedSpec.lean`](../Compiler/Proofs/IRGeneration/SupportedSpec.lean), and the `calls` interface is further split into `helpers`, `foreign`, and `lowLevel`; `calls.helpers` now inventories direct helper callees through positive summary witnesses carrying an `InternalHelperSummaryContract` plus a strictly decreasing helper-rank measure, and expression-position helper callees are tracked separately with an explicit world-preservation-on-success obligation because the current helper-aware expression semantics returns only values. [`SourceSemantics.lean`](../Compiler/Proofs/IRGeneration/SourceSemantics.lean) exposes the helper-aware source execution target those future contracts will quantify over and now defines `InternalHelperSummarySound` / `SupportedBodyHelperSummariesSound` plus direct-call consumption lemmas for helper summaries. The feature-local `state` / `calls` / `effects` scans recurse through nested `ite` / `forEach` bodies, so these boundary witnesses are control-flow complete, but helper reuse, low-level calls, and richer observables are still outside the proved generic theorem until those interfaces are threaded through the body/IR composition lemmas
- the helper-aware source semantics is now proved to be a conservative extension of the current helper-free source semantics on the existing `SupportedSpec` fragment, and the public theorem surface is already anchored to that helper-aware semantics via `SupportedSpec.helperFuel`, so future helper-summary composition can target the same source-level semantics family without another theorem-shape rewrite or trusted-boundary change; `SourceSemantics.lean` now also defines the helper-free collapse goal `ExecStmtListWithHelpersConservativeExtensionGoal` together with a reusable global helper-summary proof catalog (`SupportedHelperSummaryProofCatalog`) that feeds `SupportedSpecHelperProofs`. `SupportedSpec.lean` now separates the coarse current helper exclusion (`stmtTouchesUnsupportedHelperSurface`) from the narrower exact-seam predicate `stmtTouchesInternalHelperSurface`, further cuts that genuine-helper surface into direct statement-position heads, expression-position heads, and structural recursive heads, and introduces the compiled-side glue `SupportedCompiledInternalHelperWitness` / `SupportedRuntimeHelperTableInterface`; `Contract.lean` proves `compile_ok_yields_supportedRuntimeHelperTableInterface`, so future exact helper-step proofs can assume a generic source-helper-to-runtime-helper-table mapping instead of re-deriving it ad hoc from `CompilationModel.compile`. `GenericInduction.lean` now exposes the helper-aware induction interfaces `CompiledStmtStepWithHelpers` / `StmtListGenericWithHelpers`, the lifting lemmas `CompiledStmtStep.withHelpers_of_helperSurfaceClosed` / `stmtListGenericWithHelpers_of_core_and_helperSurfaceClosed`, the induction-level theorem `supported_function_body_correct_from_exact_state_generic_helper_steps`, the exact helper-aware compiled induction seam `CompiledStmtStepWithHelpersAndHelperIR` / `StmtListGenericWithHelpersAndHelperIR`, the strong helper-free compiled compatibility witness `StmtListCompiledLegacyCompatible`, the weaker future-proof exact-seam witnesses `StmtListHelperFreeCompiledLegacyCompatible` and `StmtListHelperFreeStepInterface`, the split exact helper-step interfaces `StmtListInternalHelperSurfaceStepInterface` / `StmtListResidualHelperSurfaceStepInterface`, the finer genuine-helper interfaces `StmtListDirectInternalHelperCallStepInterface` / `StmtListDirectInternalHelperAssignStepInterface` / `StmtListDirectInternalHelperStepInterface` / `StmtListExprInternalHelperStepInterface` / `StmtListStructuralInternalHelperStepInterface`, the exact-seam lifting lemmas `CompiledStmtStepWithHelpers.withHelperIR_of_legacyCompatible` / `stmtListGenericWithHelpersAndHelperIR_of_withHelpers_and_compiledLegacyCompatible`, the split bridges `stmtListGenericWithHelpersAndHelperIR_of_helperFreeStepInterface_and_directInternalHelperCallStepInterface_and_directInternalHelperAssignStepInterface_and_exprInternalHelperStepInterface_and_structuralInternalHelperStepInterface_and_residualHelperSurfaceStepInterface_and_helperFreeCompiledLegacyCompatible` / `stmtListGenericWithHelpersAndHelperIR_of_core_directInternalHelperCallStepInterface_and_directInternalHelperAssignStepInterface_and_exprInternalHelperStepInterface_and_structuralInternalHelperStepInterface_and_residualHelperSurfaceStepInterface_and_helperFreeCompiledLegacyCompatible` plus coarser compatibility wrappers over `StmtListDirectInternalHelperStepInterface`, the body-level finer split bridge `supported_function_body_correct_from_exact_state_generic_finer_split_internal_helper_surface_steps_and_helper_ir`, the compatibility wrapper `supported_function_body_correct_from_exact_state_generic_split_internal_helper_surface_steps_and_helper_ir`, the derivation lemmas `stmtListHelperFreeCompiledLegacyCompatible_of_supportedContractSurface` / `SupportedBodyInterface.compiledHelperFreeLegacyCompatible` / `stmtListHelperFreeStepInterface_of_core`, the exact induction-level body theorem `supported_function_body_correct_from_exact_state_generic_helper_steps_and_helper_ir`, the direct current-fragment exact-body wrapper `supported_function_body_correct_from_exact_state_generic_with_helpers_and_helper_ir`, the transitional legacy-compiled-body target `SupportedFunctionBodyWithHelpersIRPreservationGoal`, and the exact future helper-aware compiled-body target `SupportedFunctionBodyWithHelpersAndHelperIRPreservationGoal`; `Function.lean` exposes the matching function-level wrapper `supported_function_correct_with_helper_proofs_body_goal`, and the older goal wrappers (`supported_function_body_correct_from_exact_state_generic_with_helpers_goal`, `supported_function_correct_with_helper_proofs_goal`) are therefore now abstract helper-free discharge paths into the transitional target rather than the eventual helper-rich theorem target
- the machine-readable boundary catalog now makes that blocker exact rather than implicit: callers still reach the body theorem through the helper-free `SupportedStmtList` witness, and that helper exclusion is now derived directly in Lean as `SupportedStmtList.helperSurfaceClosed`; the helper-aware body theorem does not yet consume helper-summary soundness/rank evidence end to end. More precisely, that evidence is not yet consumed through the exact helper-aware compiled induction seam `CompiledStmtStepWithHelpersAndHelperIR` / `StmtListGenericWithHelpersAndHelperIR` and then into a direct proof of `SupportedFunctionBodyWithHelpersAndHelperIRPreservationGoal` for the genuinely new internal-helper cases, even though `IRInterpreter.lean` now defines helper-aware compiled-side targets (`execIRFunctionWithInternals`, `interpretIRWithInternals`) that can resolve `IRContract.internalFunctions` and `Function.lean` / `Dispatch.lean` / `Contract.lean` now expose wrapper theorems that already target those helper-aware compiled semantics. `GenericInduction.lean` now also makes the interim compiled-side boundary explicit by proving that the older legacy-compiled-body goal `SupportedFunctionBodyWithHelpersIRPreservationGoal` lifts into `SupportedFunctionBodyWithHelpersAndHelperIRPreservationGoal` on `LegacyCompatibleExternalStmtList` bodies when `IRContract.internalFunctions = []`, and it now also splits the exact helper-rich reuse boundary on both sides: the compiled side is reduced to `StmtListHelperFreeCompiledLegacyCompatible`, the residual non-helper side is isolated in `StmtListResidualHelperSurfaceStepInterface`, and the genuine internal-helper side is further reduced to `StmtListDirectInternalHelperCallStepInterface`, `StmtListDirectInternalHelperAssignStepInterface`, `StmtListExprInternalHelperStepInterface`, and `StmtListStructuralInternalHelperStepInterface`, with `StmtListDirectInternalHelperStepInterface` retained only as a compatibility wrapper over the two direct statement-position proof shapes, while the source side is reduced to `StmtListHelperFreeStepInterface`, combined by `stmtListGenericWithHelpersAndHelperIR_of_helperFreeStepInterface_and_directInternalHelperCallStepInterface_and_directInternalHelperAssignStepInterface_and_exprInternalHelperStepInterface_and_structuralInternalHelperStepInterface_and_residualHelperSurfaceStepInterface_and_helperFreeCompiledLegacyCompatible` and the body-level bridge `supported_function_body_correct_from_exact_state_generic_finer_split_internal_helper_surface_steps_and_helper_ir`. On today's fragment those weaker witnesses are now derived directly from the supported-body surface and the existing helper-free generic library, and `supported_function_body_correct_from_exact_state_generic_with_helpers_and_helper_ir` already reaches the exact helper-aware compiled body goal without a caller-supplied compiled-side premise and without requiring future helper-rich bodies to satisfy `StmtListGenericCore` wholesale. The intended legacy-compatible external-body Yul subset is now formalized directly in `IRInterpreter.lean` as `LegacyCompatibleExternalStmtList`, the weaker external-body witness is split out as `LegacyCompatibleExternalBodies`, the helper-free runtime-contract shape is now packaged as `LegacyCompatibleRuntimeContract`, and the exact first retarget theorem is now encoded as `InterpretIRWithInternalsZeroConservativeExtensionGoal`; `IRInterpreter.lean` now also decomposes that theorem into the explicit expr / stmt / stmt-list / function proof surface `InterpretIRWithInternalsZeroConservativeExtensionInterfaces`, factors shared transaction setup through `applyIRTransactionContext`, and still exposes the selected-function cut `InterpretIRWithInternalsZeroConservativeExtensionDispatchGoal` with the bridge theorem `interpretIRWithInternalsZeroConservativeExtensionGoal_of_dispatchGoal` over `LegacyCompatibleRuntimeDispatch`. The helper-free conservative-extension goal is now closed on that subset, culminating in `interpretIRWithInternalsZeroConservativeExtensionGoal_closed`; the supporting closed surfaces include `InterpretIRWithInternalsZeroConservativeExtensionStmtSubgoals`, `interpretIRWithInternalsZeroConservativeExtensionInterfaces_of_stmtSubgoals`, and the dedicated expr-statement builtin classifier `exprStmtUsesDedicatedBuiltinSemantics`, with direct helper-free lemmas for `stop`, `mstore`, `revert`, `return`, and mapping-slot `sstore`. `Dispatch.runtimeContractOfFunctions` now also has a `runtimeContractOfFunctions_legacyCompatible` bridge, and `Contract.lean` exposes the helper-aware `_goal` / `_closed` wrappers `compile_preserves_semantics_with_helper_proofs_and_helper_ir_goal` and `compile_preserves_semantics_with_helper_proofs_and_helper_ir_closed`. It now also proves that successful `CompilationModel.compile` on the current `SupportedSpec` fragment yields the full `LegacyCompatibleRuntimeContract` witness, exposing a directly consumable helper-aware whole-contract theorem `compile_preserves_semantics_with_helper_proofs_and_helper_ir_supported` with no extra caller-supplied compiled-side premise. The helper-aware compiled target remains available as total fuel-indexed helper-aware IR semantics. The remaining blocker on today's theorem domain is therefore helper-summary soundness/rank consumption in the genuinely new internal-helper cases of the exact helper-aware compiled induction seam, now cut along the same direct-helper-call / direct-helper-assign / expression-helper / structural-recursion lines as the source-side helper lemmas, and then in a direct proof of `SupportedFunctionBodyWithHelpersAndHelperIRPreservationGoal` while widening or replacing the helper-excluding statement fragment and proving the exact helper step interface at those heads. A later widening step still needs a weaker retarget boundary that can tolerate helper tables once helper-rich features move inside the theorem domain; that later compiled-side blocker remains tracked in [#1638](https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/verity/issues/1638)

**Intended end-state claim**:
- "whole EDSL" means the proof-complete macro-lowered image of `verity_contract`, not all arbitrary Lean-produced `CompilationModel` terms
- the widening target is to prove the generic theorem for that frontend image, or for a `CompilationModel` subset that the frontend lowering is proved to land inside
- the machine-readable companion for that claim and the current proof boundary is [`artifacts/layer2_boundary_catalog.json`](../artifacts/layer2_boundary_catalog.json)

### What is not fully migrated yet

- The generic theorem surface is in place, but the supported whole-contract fragment is still narrower than the full `CompilationModel` / EDSL surface.
- The contract/body support witness is no longer one undifferentiated exclusion bit, and helper calls now have an explicit summary inventory boundary, a reusable semantic summary contract slot, a global proof catalog for reusing helper-summary soundness across callers, and a dedicated source-semantics target, but the remaining excluded surfaces are still real proof gaps until the corresponding feature-local interfaces are consumed by positive theorem interfaces. In particular, helper reuse is still held behind the explicit helper-excluding `SupportedBodyInterface.stmtList` gate recorded in `artifacts/layer2_boundary_catalog.json`.
- Contracts and features outside `SupportedSpec` still rely on explicit trust-surface documentation, targeted testing, or future fragment-widening work rather than a claim of full generic compile-preservation.

**Current boundary**:
- Generic: supported statement-list compilation and the whole-contract theorem itself
- Proved generically: initial-state normalization between `withTransactionContext` and `initialIRStateForTx`, under explicit transaction-context normalization hypotheses
- No Lean axioms remain in Layer 2; 0 `sorry` placeholders remain. The `storageLookup_projectStorage` proof (previously a sorry) is now complete, using `Batteries.RBMap.find?_insert` lemmas with an injectivity argument over in-range storage slots.
- Stateful environment-reading builtins route through native EVMYulLean context construction: `callvalue`, `timestamp`, `number`, `caller`, `address`, and `calldatasize`.
- Additional explicit precondition: the generic theorem surface now requires the observed transaction-context fields (`sender`, `thisAddress`, `msgValue`, `blockTimestamp`, `blockNumber`, `chainId`) to already fit the bounded source-side `Address`/`Uint256` domains
- Outside the current generic theorem or current proof model: events/logs, proxy/delegatecall upgradeability, linked externals, local unsafe obligations, and other trust-surfaced features not captured by the current supported whole-contract fragment

## Layer 3: IR → Native EVMYulLean, GENERIC, WITH EXPLICIT AXIOM BOUNDARY

**What it proves today**: generated runtime Yul is lowered into EVMYulLean and
executed through the native `EvmYul.Yul.callDispatcher` theorem stack. The
public EndToEnd surface compares the projected native dispatcher result with
IR/source semantics on the observable storage/log/result surface. The old
fuel-parametric Verity-side Yul executor and preservation/equivalence files are no
longer part of the checked-in proof tree.

Key files: [`EndToEnd.lean`](../Compiler/Proofs/EndToEnd.lean), [`EvmYulLeanNativeHarness.lean`](../Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Backends/EvmYulLeanNativeHarness.lean), [`EvmYulLeanBodyClosure.lean`](../Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Backends/EvmYulLeanBodyClosure.lean), [`EvmYulLeanBridgeLemmas.lean`](../Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Backends/EvmYulLeanBridgeLemmas.lean), [`AXIOMS.md`](../AXIOMS.md)

### Phase 4: EVMYulLean Native Dispatcher (safe-body EndToEnd target)

The retargeting module that bridged the old `.verity` execution path to the
`.evmYulLean` backend, together with the old preservation and equivalence
scaffolding, was **removed in DoD-5** of the EVMYulLean transition. The native
EvmYulLean dispatcher is now the sole runtime authority; there is no longer a
parallel private execution chain to keep in sync.

The retained content of Phase 4 is the body-closure layer that proves
compiler-emitted runtime Yul satisfies `BridgedStmts` so that the public
EndToEnd surface (which targets native `EvmYul.Yul.callDispatcher`
execution through `EvmYulLeanNativeHarness`) can compose with those
closures unconditionally for the supported fragment.
- `genParamLoads_scalar_bridged`: scalar calldata parameter-loading prologues emitted by `genParamLoads` satisfy `BridgedStmts`
- `genStaticTypeLoads_calldataload_bridged`: static scalar leaf-load helpers for fixed arrays/tuples satisfy `BridgedStmts`
- `genParamLoads_static_scalar_bridged`: full calldata parameter-loading prologues for static scalar fixed arrays/tuples satisfy `BridgedStmts`
- `compileExpr_bridgedSource`: arithmetic/comparison/bit-operation source expressions, parameter length identifiers, storage, storage-array length, and ADT tag/field reads whose compiler field lookup succeeds, singleton and nested mapping reads (`mapping`, `mappingWord`, `mappingUint`, `mapping2`, `mapping2Word`) through the abstract `mappingSlot` bridge, mapping struct-member reads (`structMember`, `structMember2`), the reserved exponentiation builtin surface, calldata/memory/transient reads, and syntactic `keccak256(offset, size)` source expressions in the `BridgedSourceExpr` fragment compile to `BridgedExpr`; `mappingSlot` remains the mapping-slot memory+keccak abstraction boundary, and `keccak256` remains outside the full source-vs-IR semantic core until memory-slice hashing is modeled by the source evaluator
- `compileExpr_keccak256_bridgedSource_of_exprCompileCore`: specialized native syntactic closure for `Expr.keccak256 offset size` when `offset` and `size` are compile-core expressions, without adding `keccak256` to the source semantic core
- `compileExpr_mappingChain_bridgedSource`: specialized native syntactic closure for `Expr.mappingChain field keys` when every key is in `BridgedSourceExpr`, through the abstract `mappingSlot` bridge
- `bridgedSafeStmts_letKeccak_of_exprCompileCore` / `bridgedSafeStmts_assignKeccak_of_exprCompileCore`: singleton `let`/`assign` bindings of syntactic `keccak256(offset, size)` are native safe bodies when `offset` and `size` are compile-core expressions
- `bridgedSafeStmts_externalMstoreLetKeccak_of_exprCompileCore`: external two-statement `mstore(...); let name := keccak256(...)` memory-preimage bodies are native safe bodies when all four subexpressions are compile-core
- `compileStmtList_binding_leaf_bridged`: scalar-leaf `letVar`/`assignVar` source statement lists compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_pure_binding_bridged`: pure arithmetic/comparison/bit-operation `letVar`/`assignVar` source statement lists compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_storage_fragment_bridged`: pure binding plus unpacked single-slot `setStorage` source statement lists compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_terminator_external_bridged`: external `stop`/`return` source statement lists compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_internal_return_bridged`: internal `return` source statement lists compile to assignment-plus-`leave` `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_require_bridged`: plain `Stmt.require` source statement lists whose failure conditions compile to `BridgedExpr` compile to `BridgedStmts` (the emitted Yul is `if failCond revertWithMessage(msg)`; `revertWithMessage` is proven hypothesis-free to satisfy `BridgedStmts`)
- `compileStmtList_mappingWrite_bridged`: single-slot `Stmt.setMapping`/`Stmt.setMappingUint` source statement lists with `wordOffset = 0` and bridged key/value expressions compile to `BridgedStmts` (the emitted Yul is `sstore(mappingSlot(.lit slot, key), value)`)
- `compileStmtList_external_body_fragment_bridged`: mixed external source-body fragments made from pure bindings, unpacked single-slot `setStorage`, plain `require`, and external `stop`/`return` compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_internal_body_fragment_bridged`: mixed internal source-body fragments made from pure bindings, unpacked single-slot `setStorage`, plain `require`, internal `return`, and `stop` compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_external_structured_body_fragment_bridged`: mixed external source-body fragments plus one `Stmt.ite` layer around mixed-fragment branches compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_internal_structured_body_fragment_bridged`: mixed internal source-body fragments plus one `Stmt.ite` layer around mixed-fragment branches compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_external_nested_body_fragment_bridged`: mixed external source-body fragments plus two `Stmt.ite` layers around mixed/structured branches compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_internal_nested_body_fragment_bridged`: mixed internal source-body fragments plus two `Stmt.ite` layers around mixed/structured branches compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_external_recursive_body_fragment_bridged`: mixed external source-body fragments closed recursively under `Stmt.ite` compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_internal_recursive_body_fragment_bridged`: mixed internal source-body fragments closed recursively under `Stmt.ite` compile to `BridgedStmts`
- `compileStmtList_always_bridged`: universal aggregation theorem for `BridgedSafeStmts`; the external-call family (`internalCall`, `internalCallAssign`, `externalCallBind`, and `ecm`) remains outside the whitelist and behind explicit function-table hypotheses

The backend-parameterized bridge has been deleted. Body
closure now has a universal safe-body aggregation theorem for
`BridgedSafeStmts`, while the public EndToEnd theorem family targets native
dispatcher execution through `interpretIRRuntimeNative` and keeps the
external-call/function-table family carved out where needed.

Native-runtime transition status: the public theorem target is native EVMYulLean dispatcher execution. The executable native EVMYulLean path lives in [`EvmYulLeanNativeHarness.lean`](../Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Backends/EvmYulLeanNativeHarness.lean). The public native EndToEnd surface is the native result comparison/composition surface, the generated call-dispatcher and dispatcher-exec theorem family, and the concrete SimpleStorage theorem; the fuel-indexed `nativeIRRuntimeMatchesIR` seams and positive dispatcher-exec match family are file-local instead of public theorem authority. The no-mapping and mapping generated-dispatcher wrappers consume concrete dispatcher lowering and construct full emitted-runtime native lowering internally, while the call-dispatcher variants expose the actual generated `EvmYul.Yul.callDispatcher` premise and derive the dispatcher-exec projection internally.

Trust boundary (public EndToEnd target): native `EvmYul.Yul.callDispatcher`
execution is the public semantic target. The old builtin-comparison module has
been removed; it is not a
runtime authority for public compiler correctness.

Not yet proven in this module:
- external-call/function-table body closure beyond the current `BridgedSafeStmts` whitelist
- full native `EvmYul.Yul.callDispatcher` preservation for emitted runtime Yul without the remaining concrete dispatcher-exec obligations

Remaining gaps for whole-program retargeting:
- 0 sorry-backed core equivalences
- extend `BridgedSafeStmts` or add a separate function-table simulation for the external-call family (`internalCall`, `internalCallAssign`, `externalCallBind`, and `ecm`)

## Example Contract Compilation Coverage

The repository contains several different kinds of contract examples. Their current compile-preservation status is not uniform.

### Contracts covered by the generic Layer 2 theorem

All contracts within the `SupportedSpec` fragment are covered by the generic whole-contract theorem in `Compiler/Proofs/IRGeneration/Contract.lean`. No manual per-contract bridge proofs are needed.

### Spec proofs exist, contract-level compile-preservation is generic

All current contracts with spec proofs benefit from the generic Layer 2 theorem if they fall within the supported fragment. Contracts outside the fragment (e.g., those using linked externals or unsupported features) rely on testing for compile-preservation confidence.

### Semantic example, not a current `verity_contract` compilation example

- `ReentrancyExample`

`ReentrancyExample` is proved as a semantic case study in Lean, but it is not a current `verity_contract` macro contract with a contract-level compilation-preservation theorem surface in this repo.

### Intentionally outside the current proof-complete compilation subset

- `CryptoHash`: linked external Yul libraries / external call oracle surface
- `RawLogTrustSurface`: raw event emission trust surface
- `LocalObligationTrustSurface`: explicit local unsafe/refinement obligation surface
- `ProxyUpgradeabilityMacroSmoke`, `ProxyUpgradeabilityLayoutCompatibleSmoke`, `ProxyUpgradeabilityLayoutIncompatibleSmoke`: proxy / `delegatecall` / upgradeability semantics are outside the current proof model
- `StringSmoke`, `StringEventSmoke`, `StringErrorSmoke`: smoke examples for string, error, and event surfaces rather than current end-to-end proof-complete examples

Also note that the macro-generated `*_semantic_preservation` theorems are not contract-to-Yul semantic-preservation theorems. They are body-alignment equalities between generated `CompilationModel` bodies and macro-generated body fixtures, not full execution-preservation proofs for compiled IR/Yul.

1. Report the exact unsupported construct at compile time.
2. Suggest the nearest supported migration pattern.
3. Link to the owning tracking issue.
4. When low-level mechanics, raw `rawLog` event emission, axiomatized primitives (for example `keccak256`), local unsafe/refinement obligations, or external assumptions are in play, emit a machine-readable trust report via `verity-compiler --trust-report <path>`. The report groups foreign trust surfaces into explicit `proofStatus.proved`, `proofStatus.assumed`, and `proofStatus.unchecked` buckets, localizes them to constructor/function `usageSites`, surfaces localized `localObligations`, and now separately lists `notModeledEventEmission`, `notModeledProxyUpgradeability`, `partiallyModeledLinearMemoryMechanics`, and `partiallyModeledRuntimeIntrospection` so the current event, proxy/upgradeability, memory/ABI, and runtime-context proof gaps are explicit in both contract-level and per-site audit output. In human-readable mode, `--verbose` now emits matching usage-site and contract-level summaries. For fail-closed verification runs, add `--deny-unchecked-dependencies`, which now reports the exact usage site that introduced each unchecked dependency. For proof-strict runs that reject any unproved foreign surface, use `--deny-assumed-dependencies`, which fails on both `assumed` and `unchecked` linked externals / ECM modules and reports the exact usage site. For primitive-proof-strict runs, add `--deny-axiomatized-primitives`, which fails on any remaining axiomatized primitive and reports the exact usage site. For local-obligation-proof-strict runs, add `--deny-local-obligations`, which fails on any remaining `assumed` or `unchecked` localized unsafe/refinement obligation and reports the exact usage site. For memory-proof-strict runs, add `--deny-linear-memory-mechanics`, which fails on any remaining partially modeled linear-memory mechanic and reports the exact usage site. For event-proof-strict runs, add `--deny-event-emission`, which fails on any remaining raw `rawLog` event emission and reports the exact usage site. For low-level-proof-strict runs, add `--deny-low-level-mechanics`, which fails on any remaining first-class low-level call / returndata mechanic and reports the exact usage site. For proxy-proof-strict runs, add `--deny-proxy-upgradeability`, which fails on any remaining `delegatecall`-based proxy / upgradeability mechanic and reports the exact usage site; the dedicated proxy semantics gap is tracked under issue `#1420`. For runtime-proof-strict runs, add `--deny-runtime-introspection`, which fails on any remaining partially modeled runtime-introspection primitive and reports the exact usage site.
