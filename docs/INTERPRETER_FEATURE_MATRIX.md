# Interpreter Feature-Support Matrix

This document describes the feature coverage of Verity's reference interpreters,
the EVMYulLean builtin bridge, and their proof status.

Machine-readable version: [`artifacts/interpreter_feature_matrix.json`](../artifacts/interpreter_feature_matrix.json).

## Interpreters

| Interpreter | File | Entry Point | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IRInterpreter** | `Compiler/Proofs/IRGeneration/IRInterpreter.lean` | `execIRStmts` | Layer-2 preservation proofs |
| **EVMYulLean bridge** | `Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Backends/EvmYulLeanBridgeTest.lean` | `evalBuiltinCallViaEvmYulLean` | Pure builtin evaluation via EVMYulLean UInt256 |

The old YulSemantics fuel-based executor was removed as part of the EVMYulLean
transition (DoD-5); the native EvmYulLean dispatcher is now the sole runtime
authority.

The old `SpecInterpreter` module has been removed. Source semantics now live in
`Verity/Core.lean`, with the supported whole-contract Layer-2 source-side model
assembled in `Compiler/Proofs/IRGeneration/SourceSemantics.lean`. This matrix
keeps the legacy `Spec (basic)` / `Spec (fuel)` column names, and the
machine-readable artifact keeps `SpecInterpreter_*` keys, for compatibility
with the existing sync scripts and boundary checks.

Legend: **ok** = supported, **rev** = reverts (not modeled), **nop** = no-op (codegen concern), **--** = not applicable, **n/m** = not modeled.

ECMs include standard Verity-core modules for generic external-call mechanics,
including `Compiler.Modules.Calls.bubblingValueCall`, which lowers
Solidity-style `call{value: v}(data)` wrappers to Yul `call` and forwards exact
revert returndata on failure. `bubblingValueCallNoOutputModule` exposes the
same no-output adapter/router shape directly to `verity_contract` `ecmDo` call
sites. These mechanics remain explicit trust-report surfaces: Verity models the
generic call choreography, while package-specific callee behavior and protocol
assumptions belong in dependent packages.

The standard ECM library also includes static-word packed hashing helpers:
`Compiler.Modules.Hashing.abiEncodePackedWords` and
`Compiler.Modules.Hashing.sha256PackedWords`. These model contiguous 32-byte
word preimages. For static mixed-width preimages, such as an address-sized
segment followed by a 32-byte value, use
`Compiler.Modules.Hashing.abiEncodePackedStaticSegments` or
`Compiler.Modules.Hashing.sha256PackedStaticSegments` with explicit 1- to
32-byte widths. Dynamic `bytes` / `string` packed encoding remains outside the
current core surface.

Legend: **ok** = native evaluation.

36/36 builtins have universal bridge agreement proofs between Verity and EVMYulLean evaluation paths. 36 are discharged by universal symbolic lemmas in `Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/Backends/EvmYulLeanBridgeLemmas.lean`. Of those, 25 are discharged by universal symbolic lemmas for the pure fragment, and none still require concrete-only regression coverage. No builtin remains delegated to the Verity-only evaluation path.

## Proof Status Summary

| Category | Proved | Assumed | Partial | Not Modeled |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Expression features | 24 | 1 (`externalCall`) | 6 | 6 (`keccak256`, `call`, `staticcall`, `delegatecall`, `arrayElementDynamicWord`, `paramDynamicHeadWord`) |
| Statement features | 25 | 0 | 1 (`mstore`) | 6 (`calldatacopy`, `returndataCopy`, `revertReturndata`, `rawLog`, `externalCallBind`, `ecm`) |
| Builtins (agreement) | 36 | 0 | 0 | 0 (delegated) |

Proof-boundary features split across two buckets. Partially modeled features currently include runtime introspection (`blockNumber`, `contractAddress`, `chainid`) and single-word linear-memory forms (`mload`, `mstore`, `returndataOptionalBoolAt`). `selfBalance` is also partially modeled: it is compiler-supported and source-executable, but not yet included in the generic proof interpreter fragment. Fully not-modeled features currently include `keccak256`, low-level call / returndata plumbing (`call`, `staticcall`, `delegatecall`, `calldatacopy`, `returndataCopy`, `revertReturndata`), event emission (`rawLog`), and external call modules (`externalCallBind`, `ecm`). Dynamic struct-array head-word decoding (`arrayElementDynamicWord`) and direct dynamic-struct parameter head-word decoding (`paramDynamicHeadWord`) are also not modeled by proof interpreters yet. These features are still compiler-supported and are validated by differential testing (70,000+ test vectors against actual EVM execution).

## Known Limitations

1. **Nested dynamic ABI decoding**: The compiler can read checked static leaf words from calldata arrays whose tuple/struct elements contain nested dynamic members via `Expr.arrayElementDynamicWord`, and from direct struct parameters whose ABI encoding is dynamic via `Expr.paramDynamicHeadWord` (#1832). These are compilation-level ABI decoder surfaces for Unlink-style transaction arrays and the `Transaction` / `WithdrawalTransaction` / `AdapterTransaction` direct-parameter shapes; proof interpreters do not model those decoded words yet.

2. **Runtime environment reads**: `address(this).balance` lowers to Yul `selfbalance()` and runs against `ContractState.selfBalance` on the executable source path, with Foundry differential coverage against Solidity. The current generic proof interpreters do not model this balance read yet.

3. **Linear memory**: The IRInterpreter has single-word memory support. `mload`, `mstore`, `calldatacopy`, `returndataCopy`, and `returndataOptionalBoolAt` therefore remain only partially modeled or not modeled in the proof interpreters today. Full linear memory coverage requires EVMYulLean semantic integration.

4. **Low-level calls**: `call`/`staticcall`/`delegatecall` and `externalCallBind`/`ecm` are compiler-only features validated by Foundry testing, not modeled in proof interpreters. The standard `Calls.callWithValue` and `Calls.callWithValueBytes` ECMs are part of this compiler-only surface for generic `call{value:v}` adapter/router flows and are surfaced as assumed ECMs in trust reports. The EVM precompile ECMs (`Precompiles.ecrecover` 0x01, `Precompiles.sha256Memory`/`sha256` 0x02, and the BN254 curve precompiles `Precompiles.bn256Add` 0x06, `Precompiles.bn256ScalarMul` 0x07, `Precompiles.bn256Pairing` 0x08) also fall in this compiler-only ECM bucket; each precompile carries its own `evm_*_precompile` trust assumption documented in [`docs/EXTERNAL_CALL_MODULES.md`](EXTERNAL_CALL_MODULES.md) and [`AXIOMS.md`](../AXIOMS.md). `delegatecall` additionally remains a dedicated proxy / upgradeability trust boundary; use `--trust-report` / `--deny-proxy-upgradeability` when those semantics must stay outside the selected verification envelope (issue [#1420](https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/verity/issues/1420)).

5. **Internal helper compositional proofs**: `Stmt.internalCall` / `Expr.internalCall` execute in the fuel-based interpreter path, but helper-level theorem reuse across callers is not yet surfaced as a first-class proof interface. The `verity_contract` user surface for these is ordinary direct function-name calls; `internalCall` / `internalCallAssign` remain lower-level compilation-model constructors. The current proof-level gap is tracked under the Layer 2 completeness roadmap in [#1630](https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/verity/issues/1630), with the interface/boundary refactor in [#1633](https://github.com/lfglabs-dev/verity/pull/1633).
