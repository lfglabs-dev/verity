## PR Format

**Title**: Same `[Category]` prefix as issues

**Body**:
```markdown
## Summary
- Bullet points of changes

## Test Plan
How you verified it works

## Related Issues
Closes #X, addresses #Y
```

**Before submitting**:
```bash
lake build  # Must pass — verifies all proofs
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=difftest forge test  # Must pass — runs all Foundry tests
# FOUNDRY_PROFILE=difftest is required because property and differential
# tests use vm.ffi() to invoke the Lean-based interpreter
# No new `sorry` without documentation
# No new `axiom` without documenting in AXIOMS.md
# Update docs/ROADMAP.md if architectural changes
# If adding a new contract, run the checklist below
```

**When adding a new contract**, also update:
- Author the contract with `verity_contract`; do not add a separate hand-written `Compiler.Specs` body unless the workflow truly requires a special case like external linking.
- Add the macro-generated `<Name>.spec` alias/list entry in [`Contracts/Specs.lean`](Contracts/Specs.lean) if the contract should ship through the default compiler manifest.
- `test/property_manifest.json` — Run `python3 scripts/extract_property_manifest.py`
- `README.md` — Contracts table (theorem count and description)
- `docs/VERIFICATION_STATUS.md` — Contract table and coverage stats
- `docs-site/public/llms.txt` — Quick Facts and theorem breakdown table
- `docs-site/content/verification.mdx` — Snapshot section
- `docs-site/content/examples.mdx` — Contract descriptions and count
- Plus any other files that reference theorem/test/contract counts (e.g., `compiler.mdx`, `research.mdx`, `index.mdx`, `layout.tsx`, `ROADMAP.md`, `TRUST_ASSUMPTIONS.md`, `test/README.md`)
- Run `python3 scripts/check_contract_structure.py` to verify file structure is complete
- Run `python3 scripts/generate_verification_status.py --check` to verify the machine-readable status artifact is current
- Run `python3 scripts/check_lean_hygiene.py` to verify no `#eval` in proof files and `allowUnsafeReducibility` count is correct

## Adding an Intrinsic

Declare consumer-owned opcode bindings with `verity_intrinsic` only when the
consumer owns the temporary trust boundary. Keep Verity opcode-agnostic: changes
in this repository should add generic intrinsic mechanics, not opcode-specific
business logic. The consumer repository must document any generated obligation
in its own `AXIOMS.md` or trust-boundary document.

See [docs/INTRINSICS.md](docs/INTRINSICS.md) for the declaration format,
audit checklist, and CLZ example.

## Proof Hygiene Requirements

Every PR that touches proof files must satisfy all of the following.
Each requirement is enforced by CI and cannot be bypassed without updating
the corresponding enforcement script.

1. **Zero `sorry`**: `lake build` rejects incomplete proofs at the Lean kernel level.
   CI runs an independent grep scan as defense in depth
   ([`check_lean_hygiene.py`](scripts/check_lean_hygiene.py)).

2. **Zero new axioms** without a same-commit update to [AXIOMS.md](AXIOMS.md)
   including: justification, risk rating, CI validation strategy, and
   elimination path. Enforced by
   [`check_axioms.py`](scripts/check_axioms.py).

3. **Axiom dependency freshness**: If theorems are added or removed,
   `PrintAxioms.lean` must be regenerated
   (`python3 scripts/generate_print_axioms.py`).
   CI validates via `--check` mode.

4. **Proof size**: Proofs should be under 30 lines. Proofs over 50 lines
   require an entry in the allowlist in
   [`check_proof_length.py`](scripts/check_proof_length.py) with a
   PR comment explaining why decomposition is not feasible. Enforced by CI.

5. **No `native_decide` in contract proofs**: `native_decide` bypasses the
   Lean kernel checker. It is allowed only in smoke tests
   (`Compiler/Proofs/YulGeneration/SmokeTests.lean`). Enforced by
   [`check_lean_hygiene.py`](scripts/check_lean_hygiene.py).

6. **No debug commands in proofs**: `#eval`, `#check`, `#print`, `#reduce` are
   forbidden in proof files (they slow incremental builds). Enforced by
   [`check_lean_hygiene.py`](scripts/check_lean_hygiene.py).

7. **Verification status freshness**: Regenerate and commit
   [`artifacts/verification_status.json`](artifacts/verification_status.json)
   when theorem/test/axiom counts change.
   Enforced by [`generate_verification_status.py`](scripts/generate_verification_status.py).

## Code Style

**Lean**:
- 2-space indentation
- Meaningful names (`irState` not `s`)
- Proofs under 30 lines when possible (see Proof Hygiene above)
- Document complex proof strategies

**Commits**:
```
type: description

[optional body]

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

Types: `feat` `fix` `proof` `docs` `refactor` `test` `chore`

## Code Comment Conventions

Follow these conventions to keep documentation accurate and maintainable.

### Proof Status

**For Theorems**:
- `sorry` - Incomplete proof (blocked by CI in proof files)
- No marker - Complete proof
- **DON'T** use TODO/STUB in proven theorems

```lean
-- ✅ GOOD: Complete proof, no marker needed
theorem my_theorem : ... := by
  unfold ...
  simp [...]

-- ❌ BAD: Complete proof but has misleading TODO
theorem my_theorem : ... := by
  -- TODO: This actually works fine
  unfold ...
  simp [...]
```

**For Incomplete Proofs**:
```lean
-- Only in draft branches, NOT in main
theorem draft_theorem : ... := by
  sorry  -- Strategy: Use induction on List structure
           -- See issue #123 for details
```

### Module Documentation

**Module Headers** should reflect current status:

```lean
/-! ## Module Name

Brief description of what this module does.

**Status**: Complete | Partial | Draft
**Dependencies**: List axioms/external dependencies
**Related**: Links to other relevant modules
-/
```

**Status Definitions**:
- **Complete**: All theorems proven, no sorry
- **Partial**: Some proven, some sorry (specify which)
- **Draft**: Structural outline only

**Example**:
```lean
/-! ## Layer 3: Statement-Level Equivalence

Proves IR statement execution is equivalent to Yul statement execution
when states are aligned.

**Status**: Complete - All statement types proven
**Dependencies**: Uses keccak256 axiom (see AXIOMS.md)
-/
```

### Future Work Comments

For planned improvements or known limitations:

```lean
-- FUTURE: Add support for delegatecall
-- See issue #123 for design discussion
def currentImplementation := ...
```

**DON'T** use:
- ~~`TODO:`~~ (implies incomplete current work)
- ~~`FIXME:`~~ (implies broken code)
- ~~`HACK:`~~ (use `NOTE:` with explanation instead)

### Implementation Notes

For non-obvious design choices:

```lean
-- NOTE: We use fuel-based recursion here because Lean cannot prove
-- termination for mutually recursive functions with this structure.
-- See Equivalence.lean for the proof strategy this enables.
def execIRStmtFuel (fuel : Nat) : ... := ...
```

### Axiom Documentation

All axioms **must** be documented inline **and** in AXIOMS.md:

```lean
/-- AXIOM: explain the remaining trust boundary

Document why the declaration cannot yet be proved in Lean,
what guards or regression checks keep it honest,
and link to AXIOMS.md for the current trust story.
See AXIOMS.md for full soundness justification.
-/
axiom some_remaining_axiom : Prop
```

### Property Test Tags

Property tests must match Lean theorem names exactly:

```solidity
/// Property: store_retrieve_roundtrip
function testProp_StoreRetrieveRoundtrip(...) public { ... }
```

Tag format: `/// Property: exact_theorem_name`

### What NOT to Include

❌ **Stale TODOs** in completed code
❌ **Difficulty estimates** after proof is done
❌ **Verbose explanations** of obvious code
❌ **Status claims** that don't match reality

✅ **Brief descriptions** of what code does
✅ **Links** to related issues for context
✅ **Explanations** of non-obvious design choices
✅ **Accurate status** in module headers

## Development

**Layer 3 proofs**: Read [Compiler/Proofs/README.md](Compiler/Proofs/README.md), study completed proofs (`assign_equiv`, `storageStore_equiv`), use templates

**New contracts**: Use `python3 scripts/generate_contract.py <Name>` to scaffold all boilerplate files, then follow the `SimpleStorage` pattern: Spec → Invariants → Implementation → Proofs → Tests

**Compiler changes**: Ensure `lake build` and `make check` pass

## Adding Axioms

Axioms should be **avoided whenever possible** as they introduce trust assumptions. If you must add an axiom:

1. **Exhaust all alternatives first**:
   - Can you prove it? (even if difficult)
   - Can you use a weaker lemma?
   - Can you refactor to avoid the need?

2. **Document in AXIOMS.md**:
   - State the axiom clearly
   - Provide soundness justification
   - Explain why a proof isn't feasible
   - Note future work to eliminate axiom
   - Assess risk level

3. **Add inline comment in source**:
   ```lean
   /--
   AXIOM: Brief explanation
   See AXIOMS.md for full soundness justification
   -/
   axiom my_axiom : ...
   ```

4. **CI will validate**: The CI workflow automatically detects axioms and ensures they're documented in AXIOMS.md. Undocumented axioms will fail the build.

See [AXIOMS.md](AXIOMS.md) for current axioms and detailed guidelines.
